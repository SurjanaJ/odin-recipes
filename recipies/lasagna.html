            </li>
            <li>2 zucchinis, sliced

            <li>

            </li>

            </li>
            <li>1 onion, thinly sliced
            </li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, minced
            </li>
            <li> 4 tomatoes, diced
            </li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste
            </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried thyme
            </li>
            <li>2 teaspoons dried rosemary
            </li>
            <li>Salt and black pepper to taste
            </li>
            <li>Olive oil for sautéing
            </li>

        </ul>
    </div>

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C).</li>
            <li>Prepare the Eggplant: Place the eggplant cubes in a colander, sprinkle with salt, and let them sit for
                about 20-30 minutes. This helps remove excess moisture and bitterness. Afterward, rinse the eggplant
                cubes and pat them dry with a paper towel.
            </li>
            <li> Sauté the Vegetables: In a large oven-safe skillet or Dutch oven, heat a few tablespoons of olive oil
                over medium heat. Add the sliced onion and minced garlic. Sauté for about 2-3 minutes until they become
                fragrant and translucent.
            </li>
            <li> Add the Bell Peppers: Add the red and yellow bell pepper strips to the skillet and continue to sauté
                for another 3-4 minutes until they begin to soften.
            </li>
            <li> Add the Zucchini and Eggplant: Add the sliced zucchinis and eggplant cubes to the skillet. Continue to
                cook for another 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to brown and soften.
            </li>
            <li> Add Tomatoes and Tomato Paste: Stir in the diced tomatoes, tomato paste, dried thyme, and dried
                rosemary. Season with salt and black pepper to taste. Mix everything well.
            </li>
            <li> Simmer: Reduce the heat to low, cover the skillet, and let the mixture simmer for about 10-15 minutes.
                This will allow the flavors to meld together, and the vegetables will become tender.
            </li>
            <li> Bake: If your skillet is oven-safe, you can place it directly in the preheated oven. Otherwise,
                transfer the mixture to a baking dish. Bake for about 20-25 minutes until the ratatouille is bubbling
                and the vegetables are tender.
            </li>
            <li> Garnish and Serve: Remove the ratatouille from the oven. If desired, garnish it with fresh basil
                leaves. Serve it hot as a side dish or a main course.</li>
        </ol>
