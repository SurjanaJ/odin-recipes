        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Prepare the Burger Patty:

                In a mixing bowl, combine the ground beef (or meatless patty), finely chopped onion, finely chopped pickles, breadcrumbs, egg, salt, and black pepper. Mix everything together until well combined.
                </li>
            <li>Shape the Patties:

                Divide the mixture into four equal portions and shape them into burger patties. You can make them round or use a Krabby Patty-shaped mold if you have one for a fun touch.
                </li>
            <li>Cook the Patties:

                Heat a grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the burger patties for about 3-4 minutes on each side or until they reach your desired level of doneness. If you're using cheese, place a slice on each patty during the last minute of cooking to allow it to melt.
                </li>
            <li>Assemble the Krabby Patty:

                Split the hamburger buns and lightly toast them if desired. Place a lettuce leaf on the bottom half of each bun, followed by a cooked patty with cheese (if using). Add sliced tomatoes and any other toppings you like.
                </li>
            <li>Add Condiments:

                Finish your Krabby Patty by adding ketchup, mustard, and mayonnaise according to your taste.
                </li>
            <li>Top with the Bun:

                Finally, place the top half of the bun on the assembled burger.
                </li>
            
        </ol>
